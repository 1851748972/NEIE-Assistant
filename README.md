# NEIE-Assistant
A small, cross-platform program for NEIE.

## Developing
We found a [project](https://github.com/ranulldd/NEIE-Assistant) on github which is coded by Visual Basic, but it is hard to run on all platform expect Windows. So we decided to make this program.

### Process
We are now working on the function encode and decode by C++.

The next plan is to finish HTTP communicate by Python.
