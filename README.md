# NEIE-Assistant
A small, cross-platform program for NEIE.

## Developing
We found a [project](https://github.com/ranulldd/NEIE-Assistant) on github which is coded by Visual Basic, but it is hard to run on all platform expect Windows. So we decided to make this program.

### Process
We are now finished the function encode and decode by C++.
The next plan is finish HTTP communicate by Python.

## Contributing
We are free to accept to any code. Everyone can fork it and pull request.
