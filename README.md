# NEIE-Assistant
A small, cross-platform program for NEIE.

## Developing
We found a [project](https://github.com/ranulldd/NEIE-Assistant) on github which is coded by Visual Basic, but it is hard to run on all platform expect Windows. So we decided to make this program.

### Process
We finished the basic function of the software.

The next plan is to make it easier to use.

### Usage
    python main.py -s<path> -u<username> -p<password> -l<level>
